# Arithmetic Coding
Implements general byte compression/decompression using arithmetic encoding. Can be used in conjunction with other techniques.

TODO:
- [ ] Implement and use custom decimal class from `new-decimal.py` (currently still using native `Decimal` library)
- [ ] Use in conjunction with autoregressive language model for better informed next-token probabilities.
